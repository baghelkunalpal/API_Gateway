##frontend - middle - end - backend

- we need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices 
- using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request
- We can do message vilidation , response transformation rate limiting 
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.
